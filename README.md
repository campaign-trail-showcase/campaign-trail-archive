# campaign-trail-archive

This repo serves as an archive of campaign trail mods with all images hosted locally to preserve for the future. The mod files have had their urls manually replaced with links that should work locally. This is an automatic process and may have one or two hiccups. They should be easy to spot and all images should exist named with the mod name.

The errs.txt file contains a list of files that had trouble downloading during the scraping process. Do not expect these files to exist. Many of them are not image files, but some are and their original links are included.
