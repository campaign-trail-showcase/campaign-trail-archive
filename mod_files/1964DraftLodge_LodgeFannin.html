With the President’s popularity riding high off of Kennedy’s death and his campaign’s vicious attacks adding additional public scrutiny to your job in Vietnam, it’s astounding that you’ve done this well. Unfortunately though, Edwin A. Walker’s revolt in the South has stopped either you or Johnson from winning an electoral majority.</p><p>With Democrats holding both houses of Congress, Johnson’s got his four more years guaranteed with Humphrey at his side. You don’t mind that, considering he got a plurality of the popular vote, but the party has fallen into turmoil. The moderates blame Walker and the extreme conservatives for this loss while the conservatives blame your moderation. ‘68 is looking to be a nasty primary, with the party divided between an even angrier conservative wing rallying again around Goldwater and the disunited moderates, whose support is split between Governors Romney and Rockefeller. There’s even talk of Dick Nixon throwing his hat back in the ring as a compromise candidate. If any of the moderates want to succeed against Goldwater they’ll probably need your endorsement, so it seems you’re not out of the game quite yet.</p><p>In the meantime Cabot, you’ve got work to do. When you call Lyndon to congratulate him on winning the deadlock, he tells you that he’s <q>not going to let you, the next four years, sit on your tail up there in Boston and play with your grandchildren,</q> to which you let out a chuckle. The President bit off a bit more than he could chew in pressing the Vietnam issue this year and the increased focus has begun to develop into a small anti-war crowd that’s sounding more and more rowdy than he thinks they would’ve been had someone less connected to the conflict been the Republican nominee. You think Johnson is going to have to be very careful these next four years, and he wants your help in making sure things across the Pacific go positively enough for everyone back home.</p><p>With a Presidential election for the history books behind you, I guess it’s back to Saigon you go. Good luck Cabot!</p></font>";

After he lost the 1962 Massachusetts Senate election to Teddy Kennedy, he’d largely sworn off running for office, but his help in your drafting and later your campaign has reawakened a desire for public service within him. So while your time in elected office seems to have ended a decade ago, it looks like his is just beginning.</p><p>Two years later, you’ll be in Saigon watching from afar as he tries once again for the Senate, successfully this time, overcoming Democrat Endicott Peabody.</p><p>Two more years will pass, and Senator Goldwater will obtain the Republican nomination. Though both of you will oppose him, George will go a step farther than you and formally switch parties. This will create a rift between you, but in time the wound will mend.</p><p>Over the next decade, you will accomplish many things, from helping President Johnson establish a peace treaty for Vietnam to strengthening the Nation's diplomatic relationship with the Vatican as US Ambassador to the Holy See. You will see George will accomplish much too, from handily winning re-election in Massachusetts twice to being on the shortlist to run as Vice-President Humphrey’s Vice-President in his successful Presidential bid in 1972.</p><p>Then, amidst the chaos, controversy, and scandals of the Connally administration, you will watch your son, in a complete reversal of his first try at the Senate, overcome Teddy Kennedy for the 1980 Democratic Nomination.</p><p>That following November, you will stand by his side as he goes on to beat the Texas-born incumbent President in a landslide, just like you had hoped to do yourself a decade and a half prior.</p><p>Finally, on January 20, 1981, you will smile ear to ear as your son, George Cabot Lodge II—named for his grandfather as you were named for yours—is inaugurated as the 39th President of the United States of America.</p></font>";
