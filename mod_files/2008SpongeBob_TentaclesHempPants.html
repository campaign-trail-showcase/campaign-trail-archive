Yet, she was a mere Walmart employee a couple of years prior. How did she accomplish the impossible and become the first shitposter to become President?<br><br>After President Tentacles' assassination in September of 2009, his VP, SpongeBong HempPants became President, where through the gifting the American people tons and tons of marijuana, he would essentially become a God in American society, resulting in the GOP gaining unanimous control over the federal government. With one party rule, SpongeBong was effectively able to legalize and subsidize all drugs imaginable, as well as abolish the electoral college and age limits for all government offices. In this time period, we would see drug dealers and weed legends such as Snoop Dogg and Rob Van Dam becoming major Cabinet members. Although NATO was abolished and America's standing all over the world would be greatly damaged even more, SpongeBong left his second term in office with a 69% approval rating.<br><br>After the shock victory of SpongeBong's Vice President, John Fetterman, in both 2016 and 2020, the 2024 race would get shaken up after Fetterman's own VP, Apollo Astronomical, dropped out unexpectedly. It would be discovered afterwards the reasoning behind this was due to him getting the unholy shit kicked out of him in two simultaneous games of Fortnite and The Challenge Games by his wife, Luuwuu. Due to her opposition being split beyond all repair, she won the 2024 election with 5% of the vote, despite being an avowed Anarcho-Communist and most of the country not wanting her as President.<br><br>Nevertheless, Luuwuu would be inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States later that day, with her husband by her side.
