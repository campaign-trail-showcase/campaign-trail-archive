Either way, it was pretty fun researching and making this - I didn't really know much about George McGovern before I did, and I've gained some (probably useless) knowledge about him. I do feel like the writing in this mod could have been brushed up a little bit more, in retrospect - I didn't really do enough research, and I only made a few references to real-life events and figures in McGovern's life at the time.</p><p>I would like to give a very special thanks to Komnothun, who helped me greatly in making the mod - their wealth of knowledge on George McGovern and helpful comments on the writing and McGovern's positions was a great asset to me while making this mod.
