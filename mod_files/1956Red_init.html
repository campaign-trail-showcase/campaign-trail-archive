He certainly did not anticipate that it would be his destiny to seek the presidency of the United States—his candidacy being nothing more than an affair of vanity at the behest of his core supporters, but fate often works in funny ways. As Vice President Knowland's career cratered under the weight of his extramarital affair, McCarthy was the only one left with the infrastructure to clinch the nomination. Besides the Communism issue, McCarthy has also raised eyebrows by his oft-used tactic of envoking the Almighty, and such appeals could attract a new sort of voter altogether. With his loyal advisor Roy Cohn at his ear, McCarthy is confident he can protect Stassen's legacy and ensure a safer, stronger America.</p>",

        "description_as_running_mate": "<p>Bobby Seale is perhaps the embodiment of the Black Panther Party, and he's received unanimous condemnation from mainstream politics for it. Having co-founded the group with Huey Newton, he's seen his share of media attention, infamously being bound and gagged before the judge in the Chicago Eight trial – indeed earning contempt charges that will have him in prison to start the campaign. Among activists, his name is revered – among the general public, it's quite the opposite.<br><br>As a figure so unanimously popular within the Black Power movement, he would help to spread the Communist message within a key part of any coalition the CPUSA builds. His rhetorical ability is also unparalleled in the organization, and indeed far outstrip Hall's. He would generate large enthusiasm in the radical student population, where he has widespread support. Of course, there's no telling when they'll let him out of the slammer...</p>",
