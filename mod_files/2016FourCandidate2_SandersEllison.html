While a handful of Democrats, yourself included, feel happy to vote for Turner, most will vote for Kaine, including some republicans (while most will likely abstain, as McConnell is whipping votes for.) The end result, then, is a Democratic Vice President. <p><p> Meanwhile, soon-to-be House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is considering her options. Some have voiced before the election that she could change the rules to only require a plurality of votes to win a state delegation, but that’s only helpful if Trump and Rubio are in the race. Now, Hillary’s only hope is that there are no defectors towards you (top-two showing regardless,) and even that might not work: it seems like Republicans have a majority of State delegations. The most likely outcome is a deadlock (or a Rubio victory), which if unresolved, would make the next in line ascend to the Presidency, which would be (bizarrely) Kaine.<br><br><button onclick='backe0()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte1()'>Next</button></p></span><span id='ending2' style='display: none;'><p>Regardless, there’s a long time until January.
