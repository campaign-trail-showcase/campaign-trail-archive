His own race had been called for Lunsford more than an hour ago, maybe three, but it felt like years. He’s lost track of time. He watched as State after State, Senator after Senator, all fell to the blue tide. It was impossible. It was… otherworldly. As Utah was called for Trump, he felt strange. Off. He felt like there was something - some divine presence. <p><p>Was this God? Was God punishing him for some unknown sin? No, that can’t be it. If there was a God, he never would have let this happen. He never would've - McConnell’s mind raced. Raced, panicked, whatever. He passed out, waking up two weeks later in the hospital. All he could remember were 3 words - something about a campaign trail, and the word ‘spacebar.’"

McCain calls you before giving a discouraged concession speech, and Democrats have ridden your coattails to large majorities in each chamber. Your running mate becomes the first African American Vice President, a historic achievement.<p><p>On the domestic front, the outlook is fairly stormy. There’s much to be passed, from the economy to healthcare reform, but with your majority in the Senate (63 seats and counting) and your majority in the house, it’ll be easier than expected to pass them. Good luck with the economy, and Iraq. If things go right, you can run for re-election in 2012."

A more moderate candidate, probably Hillary Clinton, will likely be nominated in four years, and they probably won't draw much of their playbook from you. Maybe if McCain completely bungles it, you can make a comeback of sorts, but that’s then, not now. Now, all you can do is watch how McCain handles the economy and Iraq in these next few years.
