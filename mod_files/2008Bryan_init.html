As war and strife devoured the world throughout the 20th Century, Bryan could only watch from the heavens above in horror. Now in the year 2008, a time of war and renewed imperialism, a time of economic strife, and a time where God is being pushed to the wayside, Bryan has finally gained permission to exit the gates of Heaven and enter again the land of the living. Although Bryan is a little-known figure to most of the people of America, his excellent oratorical skills, along with what Bryan has described as literal divine intervention, have allowed him to steal the nomination from the frontrunners Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Bryan is unlike any other 21st-century Democrat and is actually polling ahead of McCain in many farm states. However, Bryan's support of free trade and general favor of farmers over industrial workers have surrendered much of the Industrial North to McCain. Bryan has also alienated much of the modern Democratic base in the big cities through his strong use of religious imagery and his unclear positions on social issues. Regardless, Bryan is still a Liberal, and if can adapt to the times correctly, he may finally get his shot at the Presidency.",
