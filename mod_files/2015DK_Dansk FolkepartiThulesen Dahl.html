No matter the results from the Faroes or Greenland, Blue Bloc will have a ruling majority with DF as the leading party. Helle Thorning has announced at her party meeting that she has resigned from party leader, but due to prior bloc agreements, Lars Løkke will return as the Prime Minister. However, if you can compromise with him, DF can stuff obtain many important cabinet posts and finally conduct politics for the forgotten people.</p><p>You reflect back on your short period as a MP for Fremskridtspartiet, and the dreams you and Pia Kjærsgaard’s had with your small splinter faction. How you went from a small breakaway to the political centerpiece of an election 2 decades later, which replicated the success Mogens Glistrup achieved in the groundbreaking 1973 election. Political analysts have already begun taking notes on the steps you've made to your great success, as Eurocrats and establishmentarians shake in their boots at DF’s victory. While negotiations with Lars Løkke over the new government loom over you due to your multitude of disagreements, at least you can enjoy this moment in all of Europe’s spotlight. Congratulations Kristian, you’ve earned it.</p>`]

Because while you did overcome Venstre and have taken over Blue Bloc, your rule will be of not much importance until the next elections due to Lars Løkke’s greater national profile. Party members say that you have done a good job, but they know deep-down that this was not enough.</p><p>However, not all is lost. You have successfully demonstrated that DF is capable of leading an extremely effective national campaign, and you have spread the message of a forgotten country. Helle Thorning has promised to look over healthcare, education and immigration reform, pushed by you and your fiery rhetoric. And maybe you can use all that campaigning experience to bring DF into a lot more municipal seats in 2017. However, watch out for splinters on the right wing of Dansk Folkeparti. They are certainly not satisfied with second place.</p>`]

With all your disagreements, Løkke will most likely just go straight to Anders Samuelsen’s LA for a government, while you have to maintain a weak position of confidence and supply. Most members of DF are satisfied with the result, but others desperately want more. A fringe of members demands even further radicalism, shifting away from our ideal of defending the welfare state to an ultraliberal right-wing populism, one reminiscent of your original political home, Fremskridtspartiet.

Splinter groups and new right-wing populist movements are already beginning to form to challenge DF’s rule, and the future of the party looks uncertain. You could either lead this sinking ship until it has fully submerged, or just resign, finish an MBA and get a new job as an administrator.
