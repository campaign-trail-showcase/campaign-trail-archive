Even at its height in the 1920s and 1930s, it was at best a pressure group, and at worst actively reviled and targeted. For years, Its influence has been waning for decades, as student activists, Black Panthers, and other New Left groups push the party into utter irrelevancy. The only thing that could ever change this is a situation in which both candidates are utterly and indisputably anathema to the mainstream American left."

Gus Hall, longtime leader of the Communist Party USA has had enough.<br><br>Hall used to be a staunch reformist, to the point that his party endorsed Johnson in 1964 to prevent Goldwater’s ascendancy. However, the coronation of John Connally at the Democratic National Convention has convinced Hall that an alliance with American liberals is impossible. At this point, the party's strategy has shifted to that of an open Presidential run once again - the way it was back before the depression. Hall will need to contend with both the chicanery the American state can throw at him as well as his own (numerous) character flaws if he wants a chance in hell of sparking the class consciousness he's dedicated his life to spreading.<br><button onclick='next3()'>INFO: Old-New Left Divide</button></p>",

Your victory speech was in front of an ecstatic crowd in South Dakota, and everyone could see the tears in your eyes. This is an astounding victory that political analysts will be studying for decades to come, and the climax of a chaotic past few years.

The party stands at a crossroads. The Republicans were able to not only turn around their devastating loss in 1964, but in fact fully embraced Goldwater's brand of conservatism to reap two major wins in a row. The Democrats may be able to do the same in 1976 and even 1980, if you put in a good fight with this election. Or, they could nominate a more right-leaning centrist candidate, in hopes of placating moderates. In any event, you can always go back to the senate.
