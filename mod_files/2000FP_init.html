The only thing that would allow you to win this election at this point is for Jimmy Carter to choose Walter Mondale as his Vice President so that you two are just as unpopular.","candidate_score":1,"running_mate":true,"scrollable":false,"partner":"0"}}];e.running_mate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2001,"fields":{"candidate":78,"running_mate":1005}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2002,"fields":{"candidate":78,"running_mate":1006}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2003,"fields":{"candidate":78,"running_mate":1007}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2004,"fields":{"candidate":78,"running_mate":1008}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2005,"fields":{"candidate":78,"running_mate":1009}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2006,"fields":{"candidate":78,"running_mate":1010}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2007,"fields":{"candidate":77,"running_mate":1011}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2008,"fields":{"candidate":77,"running_mate":1012}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2009,"fields":{"candidate":77,"running_mate":1013}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2010,"fields":{"candidate":77,"running_mate":1014}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2011,"fields":{"candidate":77,"running_mate":1015}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2012,"fields":{"candidate":77,"running_mate":1016}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2013,"fields":{"candidate":78,"running_mate":1017}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2014,"fields":{"candidate":77,"running_mate":1018}}];
