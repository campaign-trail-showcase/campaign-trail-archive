HELL!? HEAVEN!?</p>Okay, okay, I'll settle down. If you don't know, SpongeBong HempPants is a famous stoner parody of SpongeBob that first aired in the early 2000s on the VH1 show ILL-ustrated, a sketch parody series that didn't even last a year in its original run, although the sketches themselves grew online notoriety on sites such as YouTube later on. You would be correct in the assumption that SpongeBong is always high, considering that's the point of the sketches themselves. Considering this is the fucking GOP in 2008, Squidward would be abandoned by most of the party, and would be labeled as a complete joke due to this selection for his running mate, setting the party back for years in the process. Considering this is the TCT community, you will probably land on this crude joke of a candidate due to that reason alone.</p>\", \"candidate_score\": 0.0}}, {\"model\": \"campaign_trail.candidate\", \"pk\": 85, \"fields\": {\"first_name\": \"Sandy\", \"last_name\": \"Cheeks\", \"election\": 9, \"party\": \"Democrat\", \"state\": \"Texas\", \"priority\": 9, \"description\": \"''\", \"color_hex\": \"#0000FF\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#90C0FF\", \"is_active\": 0, \"image_url\": \"../../../../../static/mod_media/2008SpongeBob_init_13.png\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \"''\", \"electoral_loss_message\": \"''\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \"''\", \"description_as_running_mate\": \"<p>Your closest friend who's not running for President themself, Sandy would make the ticket have good cohesion and chemistry (pun intended).

Dan (helping with most of the writing)<p>Adeline (helping with the advisor feedback)<p> Decstar (helping with the soundtrack, the theme ending switcher, and the credits button, which was all borrowed from 2000N)<p>Danxv (helping with the endings)<p>Josh (drawing one of the ending screens for Squidward)<p>Astro (streaming my mod on Twitch and helping with some of the lore)<p>Among many other people, which includes our beautiful and wonderful playtesters!<p>It was fun making this mod, and I hope that you, the player, will enjoy mine (and many others) hard work. Anyways, have fun~<p>- Diamondy</p>
