The lack of experience in coding, I'm sure, shows to a lot of more experienced modders. I'm generally satisfied with the current running mates at this point, but I'm not sure if I'll actually finish Wallace as a running mate - I've got a lot to do, and working on a mod for a browser game is pretty far down my list.<br><br>Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this mod. I used a lot of quotes in it from Offner, and had to extrapolate a bit from White and from the 1968 election. I don't know if I really accurately captured Humphrey's political change from 1968 to 1972, and I don't claim to know too much about him - just enough to get this done. I did enjoy reading about Humphrey and the various running mates and some bizarre facts and quotes related to Humphrey. For researching the running mates and extra information about Humphrey's own opinions, I found HeinOnline incredibly useful - there are a lot of papers on there written by the political figures themselves, outlining their views. I took some direct quotes from there, too.</p>","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":4,"year":1968,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"1972Humphrey"}];e.credits = "Roniius";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":30,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":24,"fields":{"first_name":"Hubert","last_name":"Humphrey","election":4,"party":"Democratic","state":"Minnesota","priority":1,"description":"Former Vice President Hubert Horatio Humphrey, battered from his close loss in 1968, has returned triumphant, first back to the Senate, then to the nomination.

The growing movement in the party of the disenchanted left, created through challengers in the 1968 nomination and amplified by McGovern, seems to not be so happy with Humphrey. Still, too, Humphrey is cursed by his 1968 position on Vietnam.

His youthful vigor and hardworking ethic could help immensely on the campaign trail. His stance on the issues of the day is also notably different to Humphrey’s - while supporting his Vietnam plank in 1968, Harris is a friend of McCarthy and is much more dovish and liberal.
