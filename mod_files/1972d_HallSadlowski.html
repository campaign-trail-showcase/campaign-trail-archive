Shock turned into horror as it became clear that Gus Hall, avowed communist, had captured enough votes to secure federal financing for his party in future presidential races and that multiple Democratic electors would defect to Hall in protest. You traveled to DC for a rally outside the Capitol as a grim-faced Agnew read off your name in the US Senate chamber. A pale Nixon delivered a solemn address to the nation on the subject of “radicalism” the next night.</p>`, 
     `<p>For your running mate, Edward Sadlowski, the experience is transformative. A once minor labor leader from South Chicago is now a towering figure for the millions of alienated working class voters angry at the union bosses and the Establishment. The question is no longer whether Sadlowski will win his union race, no. The question is how long before Oil Can Ed leads the entire United Steelworkers of America union. He will wipe away every tear and lead a new labor movement—an inclusive and multiracial one—into the shining future. For you, the future has never been brighter. You’ve secured your place in history as a transformative figure, America's most successful communist. The party is ready to give you whatever support you need for 1976 and beyond. Even your Soviet handlers are beginning to wonder if you might be onto something with your rhetoric about a Second American Revolution being around the corner.</p><p>You disembark your train at 60th Wall Street. Wind carries the sounds of protestors rallied around the Stock Exchange. As you hold your hat, you cannot help but feel that the times are a-changin’.</p>`]

He talks about turmoil worldwide, about lessons that Americans might learn from the Weimar Republic. And then he talks about you. You turn up the volume and listen intently as he warns of a coming political reckoning and dissatisfaction with elites. You lose the signal as your car enters the tunnel.</p>`,
     `<p>Alone with your thoughts, you reflect on the past few weeks. While reporters noted odd developments on Election Day, of Black Panthers wearing hammer-and-sickle buttons and high turnout on college campuses, few anticipated just how much you’d expanded your coalition. Instead of getting a few thousand votes, CPUSA won several million. Instead of being a joke candidate, Gus Hall had made John Connally one. Electors in DC declared their intention to vote for you in protest of Connally’s racism and his campaign spent all of November begging others to remain faithful. In January, an uneasy Agnew was forced to read your name in the Senate.</p>`,
     `<p>All this upheaval has helped your running mate, Ed Sadlowski, who stands tall among the steel behemoths of South Chicago. For the first time in his life, he is not unsure about the future of labor in America. He is not anxious that America’s working class will be swept up by Nixon’s racialized anxieties or puppeted by uncaring party bosses. Your electoral success has shown that a small activist can still overcome steep odds and he is confident he will prevail in his upcoming union race. For you, the party is more vibrant than ever. There’s renewed talk with other leftist organizations about sustaining your coalition and using it to take city council seats around the country. You are invited to Moscow to discuss “unexpected developments” in America with Brezhnev.</p><p>Your car emerges from the tunnel and the radio static is replaced by more voices. You hear interviews with youth leaders, with anti-war activists, with Black men and women struggling to achieve a better place in society. In your heart, you believe your campaign has made these voices heard. While much work remains to be done, the dream of revolutionary liberation remains alive across America.</p>`]

With its reformist pretentions, the magazine has never been fond of you, but now, they aren’t comparing you not to any bloody dictators. They’re comparing you to the heroes of the Paris Commune. The article stirs something. You stare out your window.</p>`,
     `<p>In the days since the election, the attitude of the American Left toward you has shifted. You managed to prove your worst critics wrong that the Communist Party could not attract mass support. While your votes went virtually unnoticed in immediate news coverage, you made a ripple in the weeks that followed. The Times noted, with surprise, that you came dangerously close to winning several major precincts across the city. Indeed, there’s been whispering of the unprecedented support you received nationwide. Even as he’s appeared on television celebrating Nixon’s victory, you can help but notice an unease in the faces of men like Ronald Reagan. All across all the Establishment, you detect a certain sickliness. An anxiety.</p>`,

His union race is far from a sure thing, and he’s sure the bosses will be brutal, but there’s hope that Oil Can Ed might prevail in his holy crusade to save American labor. Similar successes have followed you. Almost all your critics within the party have been silenced and, for the first time in your life, your opinion is being actively sought by journalists and activists alike. Buoyed by its electoral success, CPUSA has experienced a surge in recruitment that has your Soviet handlers surprised.</p><p>You look out the window at the wintery city streets. Blanketed as they are by the snow, you see no ads, no campaign posters, nothing at all. All the world seems blank, brand new. It looks like a world waiting to be remade and, if you’re lucky enough, perhaps you’ll have a part to play in doing that.</p>`]
