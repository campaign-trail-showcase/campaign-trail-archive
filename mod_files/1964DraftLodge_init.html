This disinterest did not stop the creation of a <q>Draft Lodge</q> campaign in early January which, to the shock of the Ambassador, swept the New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Massachusetts primaries.</p><p>After continued personal appeals from Eisenhower paired with an even more unexpected upset in the West Virginia primary (enabled by the <q>Draft Lodge</q> organization successfully maneuvering Lodge onto the ballot) resulting in the withdrawal of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller from the race, Lodge finally agreed to resign his post and personally throw his hat into the ring just two days before the Oregon primary—which he handedly won. By the time of the convention in early July and with the moderates of the party coalescing behind him, Lodge won over enough delegates to overcome the campaign of Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater and secure the nomination on the third ballot.</p><p>Lodge must now work to leverage his long-standing moderation and international policy experience without further alienating the party’s increasingly dissatisfied conservative wing if he is to maintain any hope of victory.</p>\", \"color_hex\": \"#b50300\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#d9262b\", \"is_active\": 1, \"image_url\": \"https://github.com/TedThing/Images/blob/main/LodgeProfile.jpg?raw=true\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \".\", \"electoral_loss_message\": \".\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \".\", \"description_as_running_mate\": null, \"candidate_score\": 0.666}}, {\"model\": \"campaign_trail.candidate\", \"pk\": 24, \"fields\": {\"first_name\": \"Lyndon Baines\", \"last_name\": \"Johnson\", \"election\": 4, \"party\": \"Democrat\", \"state\": \"Texas\", \"priority\": 2, \"description\": \"<p>.</p>\", \"color_hex\": \"#000344\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#2e396b\", \"is_active\": 0, \"image_url\": \".\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \".\", \"electoral_loss_message\": \".\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \".\", \"description_as_running_mate\": null, \"candidate_score\": 1.0}}, {\"model\": \"campaign_trail.candidate\", \"pk\": 25, \"fields\": {\"first_name\": \"Edwin Anderson\", \"last_name\": \"Walker\", \"election\": 4, \"party\": \"American Conservative\", \"state\": \"Texas\", \"priority\": 3, \"description\": \"<p>.</p>\", \"color_hex\": \"#444100\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#6B602E\", \"is_active\": 0, \"image_url\": \".\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \".\", \"electoral_loss_message\": \".\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \".\", \"description_as_running_mate\": \"null\", \"candidate_score\": 0.7}}, {\"model\": \"campaign_trail.candidate\", \"pk\": 57, \"fields\": {\"first_name\": \"Paul J.\", \"last_name\": \"Fannin\", \"election\": 4, \"party\": \"Republican\", \"state\": \"Arizona\", \"priority\": 5, \"description\": \"\", \"color_hex\": \"#FF0000\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#FFA0A0\", \"is_active\": 0, \"image_url\": \"https://github.com/TedThing/Images/blob/main/FanninPortrait.jpg?raw=true\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \".\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \".\",  \"description_as_running_mate\": \"<div style=\\\"overflow-y:scroll;height:200.133px;font-size:1;\\\"><i><q>Let the other fellow have the credit, if that’s going to get the job done</q></i><p>Paul Fannin is a well respected member of the conservative wing of the GOP and has served as the Governor of Arizona since 1959.

This could help to minimize the risk of intra-ticket infighting that hangs over any campaign made up of members from opposing wings of a party.</p><p>Fannin is not without his downsides however, as his aforementioned close ties with Goldwater would leave you more vulnerable than you would be otherwise to attacks seeking to paint you as a right-wing radical or at least an enabler of them, as absurd as that is.
