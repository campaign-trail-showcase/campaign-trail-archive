Before the Pink starfish had a chance to even regain consciousness, the strident apprentice set the machine settings on loop, which meant Patrick would experience his first term on loop for the rest of eternity with no way of breaking out.<br><br>As for why the Sith Lords had to do what they did, let's just say they liked minuscule amounts of trolling.<br><br>"

But as they began weighing their options, two gunshots were heard in the distance, with blood soon rushing down from both men's abdomens. As the perpetrator revealed themself, you could see the shocked reactions of the two drained faces. It was none other than Patrick Star, as he began explaining what he was doing here.<br><br>”Hahahaha yes! I've finally got you two where I wanted you to be. Although it took mass amounts of fraud, I finally achieved the Presidency after a decade or so of faking my stupidity to the masses, and I'm not about to let you old hags ruin it for me. I've worked too hard and too long. But I can do this for you, yeah. I'll give you two the Old Yellow Treatment!”<br><br><i>The bodies of McConnell and Reid were never discovered, and we may never know why Patrick went through all this effort for no apparent reason.</i><br><br>"

    return "<h3>“Lord Patrick, I bring to you your approval ratings.”</h3><br><br>Your squire Kenshii has given you the last conducted polling in regards to you, and your reaction told the entire story. Even though statistical procedures had supposedly proven this couldn't occur, Patrick's approval ratings were sitting in the negatives. And when I mean negatives, I don't mean there was a higher percentage of folks that disapproved of their king than approved(although that was also the case). No, I literally mean his approval was represented by a negative integer. -5%, to be exact.<br><br>Patrick had established himself as Patrick the First, head of the newly established American Monarchy, in 2010 after unanimously winning in the electoral college two years prior, albeit in shady ways. With his opposition out of the way after falsifying claims of treason against them, Patrick stood as the one and only ruler of the American populace. Nobody could attempt to place any checks on them, or else they would suffer the consequences in rather barbaric and cruel ways. Let's just say Kim Jong Un would be horrified to find out what Patrick was cooking, it was that bad.<br><br>After the realization set in that he was too unpopular for mathematics to handle, Patrick's expression turned from one of jovial tribulation to one of anger and derision. Was he in a terrible situation before, yes. He even placed a sword which held a single line of thread above his throne to express his constant paranoia about losing power. Apparently he received the idea from some random classical myth. But regardless, he sat up without saying a single word and went to his sand-encrusted mirror to find something.<br><br>As he went to gaze at this specific mirror, he only saw a reflection of himself, at least at first. But as minutes flew by, the image reflected had transformed into what seemingly looked like a hideous caricature of himself, and it began talking. It recounted all of the morally bankrupt things committed by His Majesty, finally declaring they were one in the same. In a reaction fueled by anger and paranoia, Patrick threw his fist and destroyed the mirror.<br><br>It was at that moment both the thread holding the aforementioned sword above the throne and Kenshii's house of cards he built a couple days prior fell apart, causing a mess to insue. After seeing what happened, Patrick screamed out of the castle, before collecting himself. Surely that was just a coincidence, right?<br><br>"
